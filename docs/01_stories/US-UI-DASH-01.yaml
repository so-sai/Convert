  i_want: "to see a dashboard with System Health, Recent Activity, and Quick Actions immediately upon launching the application"
  so_that: "I can instantly verify the system's security status and start working without navigation latency."

acceptance_criteria:
  - "The Dashboard MUST display a 'System Health' card indicating the connection status (Connected/Disconnected) to the local backend."
  - "The UI MUST render three (3) primary widgets: Recent Notes, System Stats (Event Counts), and Quick Actions."
  - "A persistent 'Navigation Dock' MUST be visible for context switching."
  - "The interface MUST render its initial state in < 200ms (using Skeleton Loading patterns) before data arrives."
  - "All data fetching MUST occur via the `BackendConnector` interface to allow switching between Mock and Real implementations."

constraints:
  - "Architecture: Offline-First principle (No external network calls for rendering)."
  - "Tech Stack: Svelte 5 (Runes syntax) + Tauri v2."
  - "Testing: Must be testable in isolation using `MockBackendConnector`."
  - "Legal: All created source files MUST include the 'Project CONVERT' Copyright Header (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0)."

dependencies:
  - "Backend API Contract (System Health Endpoint)"
  - "Design System (Colors/Typography for Dark Mode support)"
