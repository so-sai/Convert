title: "Triple-Stream Event Sourcing Architecture" 
date: "2025-11-20"
status: "accepted"

context: |
  CONVERT needs three perspectives for self-aware architecture:
  1. WHAT happened (Domain Events - state changes)
  2. HOW it happened (Interaction Events - user behavior) 
  3. WHY it happened (Memory Events - AI/system reasoning)

decision: |
  Implement Triple-Stream Event Sourcing:
  - DomainEvent: State transitions (note_created, note_updated)
  - InteractionEvent: User behavior (portal_opened, search_performed)  
  - MemoryEvent: System reasoning (decision_made, alternative_considered)

consequences: |
  Positive:
  - Enables temporal reasoning and context-aware AI
  - Provides audit trail for system decisions
  
  Negative:
  - Increased storage requirements
  - More complex query patterns
